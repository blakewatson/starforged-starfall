**Star:** Hypergiant star generating turbulent solar winds

## First look

The station itself is one of the original Exodus ships that the people have repurposed into a deep space station rather than a high speed ship. Systems originally designed for traveling large distances have been removed and reused for life support and trade.

## Projects

Farpoint takes advantage of its massive star to generate a surplus of energy. They use that energy to automate resource gathering on a handful of rich moons that exist within the star system. These exotic resources are worth a lot and the wealth generated from them has pushed the Trader class into power.

## Trouble

There are a couple of factions vying for power there. The Traders have historically ruled the settlement, but a small religious order, The Silver Vanguards, has cropped up claiming it is gravely immoral to harvest and sell the system's natural resources, which they say should be preserved and revered as nature.
