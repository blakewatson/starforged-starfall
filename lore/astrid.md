# Astrid Ripley

Roland's assistant and crew-mate. Astrid is a self-taught tech expert in her late twenties.

She’s petite, fair-skinned, and has medium-long dark hair with a gray streak on one side. She has a few tattoos and a pierced eyebrow.

Astrid is a multi-threat, able to diagnose and solve engineering problems as well as technical ones. She grew up on a densely populated orbital habitat in a settlement that boasted its technological abilities. She was recruited by the Sacred Messengers and paired with Roland.
