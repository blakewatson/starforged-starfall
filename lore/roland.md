## Backstory

My small outpost town, Rhiannon Port, was destroyed when it got caught in the middle of a battle between factions fighting a war for power. The townspeople were innocent, neutral bystanders. But their town was a geographically strategic location and the more ruthless of the warring factions decided it was prudent to destroy the town rather than risk it falling into enemy hands.

I was one of very few survivors of the disaster. Picking through the ruins, trying to salvage anything useful, I found that our town's most beloved artifact was still intact. It was a fragment of the nameplate of the Nova Dawn, the Exodus ship that our ancestors traveled in to reach the Forge.

As I had no living relatives on my home world, I recovered the artifact and took to the stars. I now look for every opportunity to find my uncle, Argus, who followed a similar path years earlier. Argus is my only known living relative. I swore on the iron nameplate that one day, against all odds, I would find him.

## Background Vow

I vow to find my only living relative, Argus Duval.

## Paths

### Courier

In the aftermath of the destruction of Riannon Port, I applied to join the Sacred Messengers. I became a courier of information, helping to facilitate communication across worlds.

### Empath

I’m a contemplative, wistful soul. I pick up on the feelings of others—sometimes to the point of feeling their emotions myself or seeing brief snippets of their memories flash before my eyes.

## Notable equipment

- A fragment of the hull nameplate of the Nova Dawn with a couple of its letters visible.
- A specialized small briefcase designed for transporting small objects and storing data.
