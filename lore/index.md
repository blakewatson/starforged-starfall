# Lore

In the course of playing Ironsworn: Starforged, you develop a bit of background about the universe in which the story takes place as well as information about your character. I'm grouping some of this information into a section I'm calling Lore. Here you will find backstory, and information about people, places, and things that are relevant to the story.

## Characters

I may list more characters here later, but for now I will list some info about the player character Roland and his companion sidekick Astrid.

- [Roland Duval](/lore/roland) (player character)
- Astrid Ripley (sidekick)

## Places

When I first create them they will be skeleton files but I will write more as I discover them.

- [Sector: Crimson Maw, Outlands](/lore/sectors/crimson-maw)
  - [Settlement: Farpoint Station](/lore/sectors/crimson-maw/farpoint)
  - [Settlement: Sepulcher](/lore/sectors/crimson-maw/sepulcher)
  - [Settlement: Mudd](/lore/sectors/crimson-maw/mudd)

## [Truths](/lore/truths)

One of the first activities is making choices about the greater universe—the history, and the current nature of it. These are grouped into sections where you pick a choice for each one. I've written them down on this page. Most of it is copied directly from the book, but I modified some of them were inspiration struck me.
