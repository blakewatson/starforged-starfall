title: 'Starfall: a Starforged story'
---

I'm playing the solo TTRPG, Ironsworn: Starforged. This site is where I will post lore from the world and chapters as I play and write them.

I'm writing chapters in a narrative prose format similar to any other written story. Unlike traditional stories, this one is guided by a set of rules and dice rolls. Whenever I make a move in-game, I will record the move and the dice result in the prose and any other supplemental information that falls out of that. The story will progress based on the outcome of these moves.
